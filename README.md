# AI-Lost-Pet-Search-App

Build a platform to track the location of dogs based on Computer Vision & GPS and organize a system for protecting abandoned dogs between individuals.

#### Motivation for development 

In the 21st century, 10 million people live with their pets.
Owners who regard their pets as family members are anxious about whether they were hit by a car or taken away by their dog owners if they lose their pets.

Since you suddenly lost your pet, you may be at a loss as to what to do first to find your precious pet, but the first thing to do in this case is to go to a place where your pet might be and find it.

Based on Computer Vision & GPS, a platform was established to track the location of dogs and organize a protection system between individuals, and to solve the problem of increasing abandoned dogs, which is emerging as a social problem.
